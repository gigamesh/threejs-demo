# Description:
Experiments in interactive, 3D-rendered SVG and text using Three.js. For each example, the mouse
changes the light positions or angle of the text/logo.

## Instructions:
- clone this repo
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

## Notes:
- This is an adaptation of an old portfolio project, so its pretty messy
- TODO: add color to the logo (I don't think Three.js can import an SVG's colors)
- Ideas: more interactivity using a physics engine
